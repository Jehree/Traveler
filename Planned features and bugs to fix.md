Planned features:

DONE! -FIR upon raid exit 

DONE! (WOOO!!)-Entire hideout system

DONE! -Profile folder backup system

-Scav offraid pos system



Bugs:

-Exiting the game with items in a temp stash will cause them to be deleted. I'd like items in the
temp stash to be saved until you enter the next raid, so you can quit the game with items in it and
come back to do things with them later
